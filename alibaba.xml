The thread gave me the solution, even if it is a bit older.
I have a Sat to IP antenna from VU + (IP38) and use the Raspberry Pi 3 with TVHeadend as server and client at the same time to get the SAT to IP signal on the TV.
After trying a lot around, I got it up and running with the following settings.

Current Libreelec "alpha" (hacken bein "set all versions") copied from the website to the microSD with the downloader.
Install the "TVHEADEND 4.2" service as a plug-in in the started Libreelec.
Then configure it as follows: (Login with browser via ip and port 9981)
Configuration tab> General> Sat to IP server

--- General
- RTSP port (554 or 9983, 0 = deactivated): 554
- Subscription
weight : 100 - Allow remote subscription weight: check mark
--- Exported tuner
- DVB-S: 1

Configuration tab> DVB inputs> TV adapter
--- SAT> IP DVB-S Tuner # 1 = activated (check)
- Position # 1 (AA) Network limit per position: 1 (enter one)
- Position # 2 (AB) Network limit per position: 2 (enter two)
- Position # 2 (BA) Network limit per position: 3 (enter three)
- Position # 2 (BB) Network limit per position: 4 (enter four)

Tab Configuration> DVB Inputs> Networks
--- Add new network (DVB-S Network)
- Network name: Astra 19.2
- Predefined muxe:> 19.2E: Astra
- Orbital position:> 19.2E: Astra 1KR / 1L / 1M / 1N
- SAT> IP source number: 1

After saving, go back to
Configuration tab> DVB inputs> TV adapter
position # 1 Check (AA) at "activated" and select and save the Astra 19.2 network.
Repeat for the remaining 3.
Now go back to
Configuration> DVB Inputs> Networks> Networks
> Astra 19.2 and click on edit
> Predefined Muxe:> 19.2E: Select and save Astra

Now the channel list should be built up under the Muxes.
If not, then simply delete the entry under Muxes, go back to "Network> Edit" and select the predefined Muxe with Astra and save again.
I hope I have not forgotten anything and it works for you too.
